    "# Dimensionality Reduction\n",
    "A widely encountered problem in machine learning is that of dimensionality. We typically refer to the size or shape of a data set as an $n$ x $p$ matrix, where each row from 1 to $n$ represents an observation, or data point, and each column from 1 to $p$ represents a variable, or feature. With each additional feature, the dimensionality of a data set increases by 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "The problems with increasing or high levels of dimensionality are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- More storage space required for the data;\n",
    "- More computation time required to work with the data; and\n",
    "- More features means more chance of feature correlation, and hence feature redundancy.\n",
    "\n",
    "The latter point is the basis on which **principal component analysis** is carried out. A feature that is highly correlated with another increases when the other increases (positive correlation), or decreases when the other increases (negative correlation). This is helpful, because if multiple features tend to behave in a corresponding manner in the data set, they can often be replaced by some smaller quantity of representative feature(s). This helps to lower the feature space within which the data reside, reducing computation time as well as storage capacity requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of dimensionality reduction is to reduce the number of features in a data set while minimising the amount of data loss. There are three primary methods by which this can be done:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Principal Component Analysis (PCA);\n",
    "- Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA);\n",
    "- Generalised Discriminant Analysis (GDA); and\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook we will focus on the former, PCA."

    "## Principal Component Analysis\n",
    "The premise of PCA is that data in some higher number of dimensions can be mapped to some lower number of dimensions, whilst retaining the maximum amount of variance in the lower dimension. Broadly speaking, the following steps are involved in a PCA:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Construct the covariance matrix of the data;\n",
    "2. Compute the eigenvectors of this matrix; and\n",
    "3. Eigenvectors corresponding to the largest eigenvalues are used to reconstruct a maximal fraction of variance of the original data.\n",
    "\n",
    "These are unfamiliar terms which we encourage you to go and investigate on your own. The general idea is that we are able to compute a vector within the feature space of the data set, which points in the direction of the maximum variance found in the data. This vector is known as the principal component, and we say that it _explains_ the most variance.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second principal component is that vector which is orthogonal (mutually perpendicular) to the first principal component, and which again explains the maximum variance in this orthogonal direction. The third principal component is orthogonal to both of the first two, and explains the maximum variance in that direction.\n",
    "\n",
    "This continues for each additional principal component, until the maximum number of $p$ principal components (there cannot be more principal components than there are features). 100% of the variance can only be explained by all $p$ of the features, so we do expect that in reducing the number of dimensions we will lose _some_ data. However, Because the principal components are orthogonal and ranked in decreasing order of variance explained, we do normally expect that some subset of all the features will explain a significant proportion of the data.\n",

A county is a geographic area which is larger than a city but smaller than a state. There are over 3000 counties in the data set, which should provide sufficient information to perform PCA with.\n",

Let's set an arbritrary threshold for desired variance retained of 85% - that is, we want to determine how many principal components will be required to explain 85% of the variance in our data set. Looking at the graph, it appears roughly 12 components will explain 85% of the data. That is a significant reduction - from 34 features down to 12. Interestingly, it appears that close to 100% of the variance is explained by the first 23 components, itself a significant reduction.\n",

    "### Putting Our Dimensionality Reduction to Use\n",
    "We have seen that just 13 components of an original 34 can be used to explain 86.6% of the variance in our data set. Let us now utilise our reduced data set, consisting of just 13 components, by using it to build a predictive regressor model.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use the feature named `IncomePerCap` as the response variable (the one that we will try to predict). This feature was used in our initial PCA, so we will have to make some changes to the data set to ensure it is not included this time.\n",
    "\n",
    "PCA requires features to be scaled, as we mentioned above. But we don't need to scale the response variable which we will use for prediction, as it is not used in PCA. This is good, because leaving the response as is means any predicted values and associated errors are easier to interpret. "
